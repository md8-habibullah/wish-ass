**Movie and Series Rating & Streaming Portal Assignment Requirements**

**Project Overview**

Develop a **Movie and Series Rating Portal** where users can explore, rate, and review movies and TV series. Admins manage the media library (movies/series entries) and moderate user-generated content. Users can rate titles on a 1-10 scale, write reviews, stream and engage with others through comments and likes. The portal will prioritize performance, security, and an intuitive user experience, built using modern full-stack technologies.
